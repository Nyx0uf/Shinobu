**Shinobu** is an iOS application to control a [MPD](http://www.musicpd.org/) server and requires *iOS 14.1*. It is designed to be fast (loading my 3000 albums library happens in an instant).

I develop this app on my free time and for my personal need, you can ask for a feature but if I don't see the point I won't implement it.

I won't submit it to the App Store because I don't have 100â‚¬ to spare nor the time to deal with Apple's validation process. So if you want to use this app you will have to download the code and build it yourself.

# FEATURES

- Multi-server support (only on the branch **feat/multi-servers**)
- Browsing by *albums*, *artists*, *albums artists*, *genres*, *playlists*, or directly browsing the filesystem (your MPD directory).
- Search, *global* or *contextual*, *normal* or *fuzzy*
- Playback control (*Play/Pause*, *Shuffle*, *Repeat*, *Track position*)
- Volume control
- Playlists management (Create / Delete / Add to / Remove from)
- VoiceOver compliant
- Automatically find MPD server with Bonjour/Zeroconf
- MPD outputs selection
- Widgets (small and medium)
- Normal & Dark modes, 5 tint colors (blue, green, pink, orange, yellow)
- ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ and ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· localized
