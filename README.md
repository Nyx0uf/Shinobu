**Shinobu** is an iOS application to control a [MPD](http://www.musicpd.org/) server and requires *iOS 15.1*. It is designed to be fast (loading my 3000 albums library happens in an instant).

I develop this app on my free time and for my personal need, you can ask for a feature but if I don't see the point I won't implement it.

**Shinobu** is available on the App Store at the price of [5,99â‚¬](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shinobu/id6443788422), because putting it on the App Store cost 100â‚¬. If you prefer you can build it yourself, see below.

## FEATURES

- iPhone / iPad
- Browsing by *albums*, *artists*, *albums artists*, *genres*, *playlists*, or directly browsing the filesystem (your MPD directory).
- Search
- Playback control (*Play/Pause*, *Shuffle*, *Repeat*, *Track position*)
- Volume control
- Playlists management (Create / Delete / Add to / Remove from)
- VoiceOver compliant
- Automatically find MPD server with Bonjour/Zeroconf
- MPD outputs selection
- ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ and ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· localized

## TODO

- Rewrite the libmpdclient bridge, because it is ugly
- Apple TV version (probably never)
- An nice app icon. I have absolutely no design skills, if someone wants to help
