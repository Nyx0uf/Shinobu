**Shinobu** is an iOS application to control a [MPD](http://www.musicpd.org/) server and requires *iOS 12.2*. It is designed to be fast (loading my 3000 albums library happens in an instant).

I develop this app for my personal need, you can ask for features but if I don't see the point I won't implement it.

I won't submit it to the App Store because I don't have 100â‚¬ to spare nor the time to deal with Apple's validation process. So if you want to use this app you will have to download the code and build it yourself.

# MPD PRETTY DB

**pretty_mpd_db.py** is a python 3 script which generate a JSON file containing all the albums (*name* and *path*) of your mpd library.
It allows loading covers faster because all the albums paths will be known. Otherwise to have an album path, the app needs to query the songs of the album to get the path, this is due to the design of the mpd api.

Usage :

    mpd_pretty_db.py -d mpd_music_directory_in_your_mpd_conf
