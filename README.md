**Shinobu** is an iOS application to control a [MPD](http://www.musicpd.org/) server and requires iOS 12. It is designed to be fast (loading my 3000 albums library happens in an instant).

I develop this app for my personal need, you can ask for features but if I don't see the point I won't implement it.

I won't submit it to the App Store because I don't have 100â‚¬ to spare nor the time to deal with Apple's validation process. So if you want to use this app you will have to download the code and build it yourself.
